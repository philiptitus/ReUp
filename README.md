## Revolutionizing Waste Management with AI and Social Engagement

**REUP** is a cutting-edge mobile application designed to transform how waste is managed, making it easier for individuals and communities to locate trash collection points, dispose of waste properly, and engage in environmental conversations. The app integrates Google Maps API for navigation and Google Gemini AI for intelligent waste disposal instructions.
